# VLSI-intro-project
In this project, my group members and I designed a simple ALU using Brent Kung adder, designed schematics of it, layout for the adder, ran DRC and LVS checks and eventually simulated the circuit to extract timing parameters. We've solved timing problems and adjusted the desired delay for the circuit.
